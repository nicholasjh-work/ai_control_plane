# ai_control_plane

A governance-first AI orchestration platform that coordinates multi-agent workflows, enforces policy controls, and produces auditable, deterministic decisions.

## Why this exists
Most AI projects focus on prompts and agents. Real systems require a control plane that defines how AI decisions are executed, governed, and observed.

ai_control_plane explores that layer by introducing:
- Multi-agent orchestration with deterministic workflows
- Governance modules (policy checks, PII handling, audit logs)
- Structured decision schemas
- Evaluation and observability primitives

## Roadmap
- [x] Governance-first orchestration foundation
- [ ] Multi-agent execution engine
- [ ] Policy-aware workflow routing
- [ ] Evaluation harness and scoring
- [ ] Persistent run store
- [ ] Observability and metrics
